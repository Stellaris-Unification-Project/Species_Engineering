# Species Engineering
Stellaris mod Species Engineering aka Life Engineering

# Intro
Life Engineering is back under new name and made from scratch. As of 2.2 many things above and under the views have changed. Also my old mod had many issues both technically and gameplay wise. I removed much from the old ideas and focus on creating species only. So here it is, Species Engineering.

# Compatibility
* No vanilla files touched, so it works with all other mods. You can even create species on custom worlds like the ones from planetary diversity without any patch
* Universal Resource Patch is not mandatory but recommended to see the special resource stockpile

# Contribution notes
* Any overwrite of vanilla files, assets, rules, etc. is forbidden.
* New features must be localised (if any) in english language, additional localisations are appreciated
* This repository uses git flow as branching strategy
